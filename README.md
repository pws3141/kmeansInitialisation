# Compare three initialisation methods for k-means clustering on the projective space

## [Forgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Initialization_methods)

Random points chosen as the cluster centers. Data then assigned to clusters based on
proximity to these centers.

## [Random partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Initialization_methods)

Points randomly assigned to a cluster.

## [k-means ++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B)

Random points chosen as the cluster centers with probability proportional to the
minimum distance to already selected points.
